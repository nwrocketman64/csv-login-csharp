# csv-login-csharp
This is demo code that test login in C# by reading csv file.

# What I have learned from this project
I have nevered worked with C# before but I have found that C# is just a mix
between C / C++ and Java. Because of this, I had a very easy time figuring out
the overall structure and syntax of C# and I was able to get this program to
run under Microsoft's .NET framework. In order to run the program, use
dotnet run in the folder.
